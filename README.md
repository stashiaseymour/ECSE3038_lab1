## Description
This project contains three simple Python functions for an introductory programming assignment.


## Summary of the Functions

### 1. **parallel()**
- **Summary**: 
  This function calculates the effective resistance of a network of resistors connected in parallel. It accepts a list of resistor values and calculates the total effective resistance using the parallel formula.
- **Expected Behaviour**:
  When the function is called with a list of resistor values, it will print the effective resistance of the resistors in parallel in ohms.


### 1. **potential_divider()**
- **Summary**: 
  This function calculates and prints the voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit given a total voltage supply and a list of resistor values.
- **Expected Behaviour**:
  The function should print the voltage drop across each resistor in the series circuit.

 

  ### 1. **temperature_check()**
- **Summary**: 
  This function checks the body temperature of a patient and determines whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic, or has a normal body temperature. It accepts the temperature value and the unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
  When the function is called with a list of resistor values, it will print the effective resistance of the resistors in parallel in ohms.
**Expected Behaviour**:
  The function will output a message based on the temperature condition, stating whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic, or has a normal temperature, depending on the unit used (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
